# Development of Embedded System for Monochromator
Very Large Scale Integration - VHDL Coding

Spectrometer is a device used to represent the intensity as a function of wavelength. It consists of two main parts A Monochromator and a photo detector. Monochromator is an optical device used for separating component wavelengths of light. The diffraction element used is a grating. Optical setup is optimized in a space of 15cm * 15cm * 5cm.

Diffraction grating, with a periodic structure diffracts incident light into its constituent wavelengths. Reflection grating is used in this project. Angle at which incident spectral line gets diffracted depends upon the incident wavelength and the order of diffraction. If white light is incident on diffraction grating, then diffracted light consists of complete visible spectrum.

To study the behavior of synthesized material with respect to each wavelength diffracted from grating, we put an image sensor to cover the whole spectrum in a single sweep. We are using a CCD detector for capturing the spectrum.

To process the data that has been acquired by the spectrum, we are using Reconfigurable Logic Devices, as it can be reprogrammed according to user needs. We are using the NUMATO MIMAS SPARTAN6 Module, which has the capacity to acquire the data, process, and store and eventually send the data, to plot the graph on the PC for monitoring. USB is an interface for communicating with many types of peripherals without the limitations of older interfaces. Every recent PC includes USB ports that can connect to standard peripherals such as keyboards, mice, scanners, cameras, printers, and drives as well as custom hardware for just about any purpose. An interface must please the users who want to use the peripherals and the developers who design the hardware and write the code that communicates with the device. USB does that job.
